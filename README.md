# NFT-Marketplace-hackathon-ribble
## Inspiration  The current rise in cryptocurrencies in India inspired us to make a project based on NFT using BlockChain.  ## What it does NFT Rible is a game centered around collectible unique items that are used to create one-of-a-kind avatars where the uniqueness is guaranteed by ERC721 protocol. No items can bereplicated, taken away, or destroyed, since the proof of ownerships are stored on Ethereum blockchain. In order to see the items and interact with the marketplace, user has to installMetaMask extension to her/his browser. Then, by connecting his/her wallet; the user can buy, bid on, offer items for auction and sell the items via the marketplace. As tree requiredand complementary pieces are purchased and worn, an avatar is created and displayed to the community.  ## How we built it  Client: React, Recoil, Material UI  Contract: Solidity  Dev Tools: Ganache, Truffle, Remix, Docker  Static Smart Contract Analysis: Security 2.0, Slither  Testing: Mocha  ## Challenges we ran into  We faced many of the difficulties in fixing and debugging the code  ## Accomplishments that we're proud of  We made it at last :)  ## What we learned  We learnt lot of new things like solidity and etherum implementation in NFT's  ## What's next for NFT Rible  We'll make improvements to it and will be open-sourced for public use.
